 <h2>Charleston</h2>
	<p class="infotxt">Charleston begins with the tab for each hand displayed as follows:
	
	<div class="winimg" >
		<img id = "win1" src = "Video/MahJongg5.jpg"
	</div>
		</p>
	<p>
		
		As you click on the tile you wish to pass it is moved to the "Charleston Out" area leaving a blank space on the rack and the "Undo" button is enabled.  Throughout the Charleston there is an indication at the lower left noting which pass is taking place.
		<div class="winimg" >
		<img id = "win2" src = "Video/MahJongg6.jpg"
	</div>

</p>
	
<p>
		
		When all three tiles have been selected the "Pass" button is enabled.
		<div class="winimg" >
		<img id = "win2" src = "Video/MahJongg7.jpg"
	</div>

</p>	

<p>When you click on the "Pass" button the tiles are removed from the "Charleston Out" area and the "Pass" button is again disabled.
		<div class="winimg" >
		<img id = "win2" src = "Video/MahJongg8.jpg"
	</div>

</p>
<p>At the same time the passed tiles appear in the "Charleston In" area of the receiving window but the values are hidden.
		<div class="winimg" >
		<img id = "win2" src = "Video/MahJongg9.jpg"
	</div>

</p>	
	<p>When the receiving window has completed its pass as well the "Get" button is enabled.
		<div class="winimg" >
		<img id = "win2" src = "Video/MahJongg10.jpg"
	</div>

</p>
</p>	
	<p>When you click on the "Get" button the passed tiles are moved from the "Charleston In" area to the rack.  To avoid confusion I find it is easier to complete all passes for a round and then complete all gets for that round.
		<div class="winimg" >
		<img id = "win2" src = "Video/MahJongg11.jpg"
	</div>

</p>
<h3>Blind Pass</h3>
</p>	
	<p>On the third and sixth rounds the "Blind Pass" button is enabled.  You may blind pass none to three tiles.  This is done by clicking on the "Blind Pass" button then dragging a tile from the "Charleston In" area to the "Charleston Out" area.  In the current implementation of the game at least one window must pass three tiles.
		<div class="winimg" >
		<img id = "win2" src = "Video/MahJongg12.jpg"
	</div>

</p>

<h3>Optional Pass</h3>
</p>	
	<p>The optional pass of 0, 1, 2, or 3 tiles occurs either after the third pass if the stop button has been pressed or after the sixth pass. 
	Click on the little down arrow and select the number of tiles to be passed.  The number selected must agree with the number selected on the receiving window.  The "Pass" button is always enabled during the optional pass.  Even if you select 0 tiles to pass you must click on the "Pass" and "Get" buttons as this triggers the change in the window layout for the game to proceed.
